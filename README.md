# bubble-comparison
It is a nlogn time complexity algorithm that finds matching sums.

The file has two lines. The first line has the n and k values in this order and the second line has the numbers. An example input file is as following. According to this input data, n=5, k=7. The numbers are 3, 1, 2, -4, 4. Your program should return “yes” for this example as 3+4=7=k.
